# README for shattering_blast


[shattering_blast.sh](shattering_blast.sh) is the script was used to run the analysis. The file [shattering_fasta_list.txt](shattering_fasta_list.txt) is needed for the script to run. It contains the list of genes we want to blast against the Northern Wild Rice (NWR) genome to find NWR orthologs. **Note:** This was done before the PBS-to-SLURM conversion so if you want to re-run this, you would need to change the header syntax.

FASTA files for each of the genes of interest are located in the [FASTA_input](FASTA_input) directory.
